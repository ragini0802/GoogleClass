<h1><font color="white"><center>Computer science:</center></font></h1>
<p><font color="yellow" >The study of computation and information. Computer science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational problems and the design of computer systems hardware, software and applications.</font></p>
<p><font color="yellow" >It addresses both human-made and natural information processes, such as communication, control, perception, learning and intelligence especially in human-made computing systems and machines.</font></p>
<p><font color="yellow" >Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines.For example computational complexity theory describes the amount of resources required to solve computational problems, while computer graphics and computational geometry emphasizes more specific applications.</font></p>
